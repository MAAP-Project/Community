# Guide for the Data Team

This is a short Readme specific to Data Team (MSFC) tasks, and usage of Zenhub.

## Zenhub

To make full use of Zenhub you need to install the browser extension. This will allow you to the Workspaces under the Zenhub tab in each repo.

## Issues

You can file tickets either from the Zenhub DataTeam workspace, or on the respective github repo the issue relates to. The workspace board will aggregate the tickets for viewing in a single board.

If the issue is general to the platform, you aren't sure which repo it belongs in, or is coming from a platform **user** file it under the Zenhub repo, and add appropriate labels. If it concerns the data team label **MSFC**, use as many labels as seems relevant.

## Data Requests

End users for now will be encouraged to file tickets in the [Zenhub](https://github.com/MAAP-Project/ZenHub) repo. This includes requests for upgrades to, or new data. For data requests, users should select the data request template.
